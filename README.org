* Installation:
Due to the diverse nature of these configurations and potential system variations, there's no one-size-fits-all installation process. However you can carefully examine the files and adapt it to your specific requirements. The below script is only for Arch users.

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/lumidenoir/dotfiles
cd ./dotfiles
./install.sh
#+end_src
